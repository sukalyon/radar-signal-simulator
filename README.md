# ðŸ“¡ Radar Signal Simulator ðŸ“¡

##  Description

This project is a beginner-to-intermediate level **Python-based radar signal simulator** developed to understand the fundamental concepts of radar systems. It demonstrates how a radar transmits a pulse and receives echoes from targets at varying distances with corresponding time delays.

##  Features

-  Transmitted pulse signal generation
-  Echo simulation from targets at various distances
-  Time delay (based on speed of light and range)
-  Addition of Gaussian noise for realism
-  Radar Cross Section (RCS) effects for target reflectivity
-  Visualization using Matplotlib

##  Objective

This simulator is intended as an educational tool to help learners understand:

- How radar echoes behave with distance
- The impact of signal delay
- The influence of noise and RCS on target detection

##  Planned Extensions

- Doppler effect and moving targets
- Matched filtering for better target detection
- Plan Position Indicator (PPI) style 2D radar display
- Target recognition and classification

##  Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
